# earthtoken-smartcontract
The source code of the earth token smart contract based on the ERC20 standard.

# Introduction
The Natural Asset Exchange blockchain platform and Earth Token cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) token sale provides a unique opportunity to truly transform the Natural Capital Asset market, by creating a Natural Asset Marketplace that allows all stakeholders in the climate value chain to participate.

Token Holder value is created due to the dynamics of supply & demand where the medium of exchange is in limited supply. As the value and volume of transactions across the Natural Asset Exchange increases using EARTH as the settlement mechanism, due to fixed supply, naturally the value should appreciate due to scarcity, which in turn should lead to an increase in the market capitilisation of EARTH.
